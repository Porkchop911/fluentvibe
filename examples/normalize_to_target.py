"""Normalization to target — Phase A.4 (with documented limitation).

What real normalization looks like:
    Source plate has varying concentrations per well. To bring every well
    to the same final concentration, dilute each well by a *different*
    volume of buffer — i.e. per-well volume targeting.

What v1.1 can do:
    The MCA-96 head's aspirate / dispense is auto-parallel over
    ``labware.wells.values()`` with a *single* volume scalar — every
    channel pulls/pushes the same amount. Per-well varying volumes
    require either:
      (a) per-well-volume vectors on ``AspirateStep`` / ``DispenseStep``
          (IR + simulator change), or
      (b) an FCA single-channel head (no FCA head class in v1.1; IR
          steps exist but the simulator doesn't dispatch them).

This example therefore models *uniform* normalization (every well
diluted by the same volume), which is still a useful protocol shape:
add a fixed buffer volume to every well of a plate that already has
varying liquid amounts. The well-state divergence between wells exists,
but the dilution math is uniform.

Tracked as a gap. Real per-well normalization will land in v1.2 once
either (a) or (b) is built.
